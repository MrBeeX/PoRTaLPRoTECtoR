Infinite Tower Defense Game by **Nico Fischer & Niclas HÃ¶rber**.
Developed for python module on DHBW Stuttgart.


## Description

Classical Tower Defense game in a modern look:

Place futuristic towers to defend your base. You can use 8 different towers for this. Each of these towers has 3 levels.
All these towers are fully animated and calculate the angle to turn perfectly in order to hit the opponents everytime.


We wrote an algorithm that calculated 16 million possible maps (found in mapgen.py). From these 16 million we then took 30,000 maps for our use case and sorted them into 3 classes (easy / medium / difficult).

All textures were created by hand!
